# LSU Unenrolled Grader Report

## What is it?
The LSU Unenrolled Grader Report is a clone of the Moodle Grader Report with significant changes allowing teachers to view the last entered grades for students who have been unenrolled from the course.

## Why is it?
We actually unenroll students from courses instead of making their enrollments inactive, this grader report allows teachers to look back on students who've dropped the course.

## Can I help make it better?
We would love it! Please fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
